# orbit

## introduction

'orbit' is a small competitive multiplayer game in which you fight for space around your planet.

## goals

1) Planet, prepare in blender and try to do reproduce in amethyst
2) Replace rotation mouse controls
3) Sun that lights the planet
4) Space 360 map
5) You spawn from the planet itself, rising from the surface
6) You have responsive controls to exort forces over your orbit
- After a kill, you can collect the rubble on next orbit for upgradables
- Experiment with different control schemes
- You attach eachother by shooting at eachother while passing orbits
- You have a home base and starting home base on the planet linked to your actual location

## stretch goals

- Goal perhaps to escape the planet?
- Teamwork needed?

## notes

Material maps:
- Albedo
- Normal
- Metallic roughness
- Metallic (metallic roughness x)
- Roughness (metallic roughness y)
- AO ao_map
- Emissive (not needed I think)

## roadmap 

- FXAA antialiasing (because other AA is deeply embedded in the pipeline)

- Stars background
- Sun in the distance
- Tonemapping?
